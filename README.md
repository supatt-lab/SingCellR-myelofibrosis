# SingCellaR-myelofibrosis
This is the shiny application software that can visualise single-cell RNA-seq data. We aim to visualise scRNA-seq data derived from myelofibrosis patients and healthy donors (Psaila and Wang et al., Mol. Cell, 2020). Currently, the data are under restriction to the public. We will soon release the software and data whenever the accepted paper will be officially published in Molecular Cell.
