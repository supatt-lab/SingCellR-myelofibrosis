# SingCellaR-myelofibrosis
This is the shiny application software that can be used to visualise single-cell RNA-seq data. We aim to visualise scRNA-seq data derived from myelofibrosis patients and healthy donors (Psaila and Wang et al., Mol. Cell, 2020). However, the data are currently under restriction to the public because the paper has been under reviewed. We will release the software and data whenever the paper will be published.
